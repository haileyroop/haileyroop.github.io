Welcome! I am a recent graduate from McGill University in the Environment department with a specialization in Economics. I am interested in sustainable food systems, collective action initiatives and many other topics. Throughout my years in environmental studies I have been involved with the Green Party of Quebec and the town of Montreal West's Environment Action Committee, and was the co-president of Mealcare McGill. 

Find out more about my academic research projects [here](/research/), and check out my [CV](/assets/pdf/CV_References_2024.1.pdf) to learn about my work experience.
